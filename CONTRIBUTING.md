### Existing functions

Feel free to enhance the existing functions. Please try not to introduce breaking changes.

### New functions

There are some notes for adding new functions

- Before you start working, it's better to open an issue to discuss first.
> Please note you don't need to update packages' `index.ts`. They are auto-generated.

## Code Style

Don't worry about the code style as long as you install the dev dependencies. Git hooks will format and fix them for you on committing.
